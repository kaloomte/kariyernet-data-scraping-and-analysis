# Kariyer.net Data Scraping and Analysis

Firstly scraping data from Kariyer.net website with BeautifulSoup. Then make data more pretty and understable and readable plots.
Plotly library has been used for visualization so some plots don't show because of github.

Plotly is a nice library for interactive dashboard plots but Unfortunately github doesn't support it so i think about how to putting this plot as a image file to readme. To see interactivity of plots please clone the repo and look it with locale jupyter notebook.
